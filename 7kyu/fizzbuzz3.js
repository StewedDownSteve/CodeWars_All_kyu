// Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. However, when the integer is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”; when it’s divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”; when it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz”.


function fizzBuzz(num){
    for (let i = 0; i < 100;) console.log((++i % 3 ? '' : 'Fizz') + (i % 5 ? '' : 'Buzz') || i)
