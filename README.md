# CodeWars_All_kyu
A collection of Code Wars challenges. All different kyus. I average around 5-7 challenges weekly.

**Link to project:** (https://www.codewars.com/users/StewedDownSteve)

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** JavaScript

Doing at least one challenge daily is how I continue to learn and warm my brain up for more coding projects.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, and sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
